import React, { Component } from 'react'

class Header extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <header>
        <h1>responsive flexbox article listing</h1>
        <p>
          Flexbox is an amazingly powerful layout tool. In this example I have
          created a responsive grid of articles that increased the amount of
          visible articles on the page at larger resolutions.
        </p>
      </header>
    )
  }
}

export default Header;
